# CorDapp Template - Kotlin

Welcome to the Kotlin CorDapp template. The CorDapp template is a stubbed-out CorDapp that you can use to bootstrap 
your own CorDapps.
It includes a custom state, contract and flow for the transaction of a car between 3 nodes: Dealer, Manufacturer and Bank.
Servers along with ports(configured through rpc) are provided in the client build.gradle as per the corda norms.
Nodes are defined for each participant in the main build.gradle file.
